# Anti Spark Switch
Personal improvements/changes to the vedder antispark switch

Design allows for a battery to be connected to a source without the usual spark in the connector, also provides a convenient on off ability.
Improvements to the design include an upgraded, more robust fuse and fuse holder, an additional MOSFET for higher current handling as well as
better distribution of power through the MOSFETs. One other change is an optional 12V supply tap that can be used for an LED button if desired, 
the 12V (5V) must be supplied externally.
